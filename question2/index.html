Surprise!  
The Central Park Zoo proudly presents...
Manhattan.
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.
You look like a monkey,
It just did! Even the star's out.
Two little words.
New York. 
He wouldn't fit down there.
Marty? Marty? Marty?
Ah! Here it comes.  
Grand Central Station!
It's grand and it's central.
I got something for you!
Just went a little cuckoo in the head.
Hey! Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head!
Hey, little help.
He's awake! He's awake!
Complete with fake rocks.
Wow! That looks real.  
Let the animals run wild!
Next thing you know...
The Foosa! The Foosa!
The Foosa are attacking!
I hate spider webs.
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
No!
You must tell me, who the hack are you?
I'm Alex. The Alex.
Yeah, right.
You know something?
I bet they are already on their way.
Now everybody! We all have
great curiosity about our guests.
You have food?
The fun side special, coming up!
What a hack is going on?
Let's go wild!
Alex, what did you do?
He bit me on the butt!
No. 
What is wrong with me?
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.  
Rico. We'll need special
tactical equipment.
Foosa ha!  
Foosa uh!  
Foosa ha!
